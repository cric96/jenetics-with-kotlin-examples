# Jenetics with Kotlin
This repository contains some examples of [Jenetics](https://jenetics.io/) library used with Kotlin.

It mainly reproduce the example explained [here](https://jenetics.io/manual/manual-6.2.0.pdf).

Furthermore, there are experiments in which I try to train neural networks, leveraging also the [Deepleanring4J](https://deeplearning4j.org/) library.
